   └─ Further improves net profit

4. Entity Structure:
   ├─ C-Corp: Subject to 25% tax
   ├─ S-Corp: Pass-through (owners pay personal tax)
   ├─ LLC: Flexible (can elect partnership or C-Corp)
   └─ Recommendation: Consult CPA for optimization

## Recommendations

### Optimize Tax & Fees

1. **Negotiate processing fees**
   - Stripe offers volume discounts at 1-2%
   - At $2M+ revenue, negotiate to 1.5% + $0.20
   - Potential savings: $10-15k/year

2. **Maximize tax deductions**
   - Document all R&D (development, infrastructure research)
   - Track eligible expenses for R&D tax credit (20-30%)
   - Example: $100k in R&D could generate $20-30k tax credit

3. **Consider entity structure**
   - C-Corp: Good if retaining earnings
   - S-Corp: Better for founder-heavy businesses
   - LLC: Flexible, consult CPA

4. **Plan for growth**
   - At $500k+ revenue, hire bookkeeper
   - At $1M+ revenue, hire CFO (part-time consultant)
   - Quarterly tax planning saves 5-10% on taxes

---

## Conclusion

**Your pricing model remains highly profitable even after processing fees and taxes:**

- **Professional tier**: $33/month net profit per customer (67.5% margin)
- **Enterprise tier**: $205/month net profit per customer (41.1% margin)
- **Company net profit**: $207k by Year 3, $585k by Year 5

The slight impact of fees/taxes (reduces profit by ~33% vs gross margin) still leaves you with:
- 26-27% net profit margins by Year 3-5
- $207k-$585k annual profit depending on scale
- Strong unit economics ($397/year net profit per Professional customer)

**This is a genuinely profitable SaaS business model.**
