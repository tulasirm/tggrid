## 💡 Pricing Strategy

### Why $49 for Professional?
```
Original $99 → Optimized to $49 because:

✓ Exceeds 50% margin target (78.5%-93.6% actual)
✓ Can be more competitive without sacrificing profit
✓ 50-75% cheaper than industry standard ($99-199)
✓ Increases Starter→Professional conversion
✓ Better for market share and growth
✓ Maintains exceptional unit economics
✓ Leaves room for price protection if challenged
```

### Why Overage Pricing?
```
$0.01 per session beyond limit because:

✓ Aligns customer growth with revenue growth
✓ Avoids hard tier limits and churn
✓ Maintains 78.9% margin on overages
✓ Auto-upgrade path without friction
✓ Captures long-tail customers
✓ Rewards customer success
└─ Example: Customer at 7,500 sessions pays $49 + (1,500 × $0.01) = $64
```

### Why Custom Enterprise?
```
Rather than fixed tier because:

✓ Accommodates 50,000 - 500,000+ session range
✓ Enables dedicated support (account manager, SLA)
✓ Supports custom integrations and on-premise
✓ Maintains healthy margins while discounting
✓ Allows volume negotiations

## 🔐 Margin Safety
